# Vexed-with-graphics
In this program we were given partial code for the graphics and only had to incorporate the recursive part of the program for the game to work.
The recursive part of the code checks if the block at hand is the same color as the ones surrouding it, if it is then it'll destroy that
function and then call itself again but for a new location. We primarly used classes in this program.
